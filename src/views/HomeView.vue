      Routing in Vue is used to navigate the Vue application, and it happens on
      the client side (in the browser) without full page reload, which results
      in a faster user experience. Routing is a way to navigate, similar to how
      we have used dynamic components earlier. With routing we can use the URL
      address to direct someone to a specific place in our Vue application.
